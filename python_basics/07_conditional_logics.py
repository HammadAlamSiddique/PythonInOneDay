# conditional logics are either 'true or false' or 'yes or no' or '0 or 1'
# equal to                      ==
# not equal to                  !=
# less than                     <
# greater than                   >
# less than or equal to          <=
# greater than or equal to       >=


# examples
# print(4==4)
# print(4!=4)
# print(4>4)
# print(4<4)
# print(4>=4)
# print(4<=4)

# application of logical operators
# hammad_age = 5
# age_at_school = 6
# print(hammad_age == age_at_school)  

# input function and logical operator
age_at_school = 6
hammad_age = input("How young is Hammad? ")  # input function
hammad_age = int(hammad_age)
print(type(hammad_age))
print(age_at_school == hammad_age)  # logical operator
